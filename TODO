* chnage all relevant fetchers/actions to use msg UID instead of ID
* do not fetch message BODY when not necessary
* change config structure so that plan is based on specific account; this
  way we would fetch messages only once for specific fetcher instead of
  doing it over and over again
* maybe some DB preserving of fetched messages would be nice
